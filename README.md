### Description
This is one of my early 3D game development projects.  
The player controls a **slime character** that constantly moves forward inside a **cylindrical tunnel**, similar to a sewer environment.

### Features:
- Fast-paced arcade gameplay  
- Slime character with simple animations  
- Movement along a tunnel (up / down mechanics)  
- Main menu with sound effects  
- Basic post-processing effects  
- Casual difficulty curve  

### Notes:
It reflects my early experience with:
- 3D movement systems  
- Arcade-style gameplay design  
- UI menus and sound integration  
- WebGL builds for Yandex Games  

### Status
🗃️ **Legacy / Archive project**  
No active development — kept for documentation and personal growth tracking.
